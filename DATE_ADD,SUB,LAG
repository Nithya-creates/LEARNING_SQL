**DATE_ADD:**

SELECT W1.id AS Id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
  ON W1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(W2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;

**DATE_SUB (just flip the logic):**

Instead of saying W1 = W2 + 1 day,
we can say W2 = W1 − 1 day:

SELECT W1.id AS Id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
  ON W2.recordDate = DATE_SUB(W1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;

**DATEDIFF:**

SELECT W1.id AS Id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
  ON DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;

**window function:**

We can use LAG to look at the previous day’s temperature without self-join:
SELECT id
FROM (
  SELECT id,
         recordDate,
         temperature,
         LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp,
         LAG(recordDate) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_date
  FROM Weather
) t
WHERE DATEDIFF(recordDate, prev_date) = 1
  AND temperature > prev_temp;
