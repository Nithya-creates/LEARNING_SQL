Code
SELECT
    CHAR_LENGTH('€') AS CharacterLength,
    LENGTH('€') AS ByteLength;

Expected Output:
CharacterLength - 1
ByteLength - 3

In summary:
Use CHAR_LENGTH() when you need to know the number of visible characters in a string, which is often more intuitive for human-readable content.
Use LENGTH() when you need to know the actual storage size of the string in bytes, which can be relevant for performance or storage considerations.
